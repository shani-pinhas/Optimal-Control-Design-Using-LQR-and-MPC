# Optimal-Control-Design-Using-LQR-and-MPC
This project explores optimal control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to minimize a quadratic cost function while ensuring stability and high performance. It compares unconstrained and constrained LQR designs and demonstrates how Model Predictive Control (MPC) extends LQR to efficiently handle system constraints in real time.
